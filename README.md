# Pomodoro Timer Widget

This is a Pomodoro timer widget designed using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and vanilla JavaScript. It helps you manage your work or study sessions effectively with timed intervals and task tracking features.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Set intervals for work (25 minutes), short breaks (5 minutes), and long breaks (15 minutes).
- **Task Tracking**: Add tasks to complete during each Pomodoro session. Tasks can be checked off as completed, and the timer tracks the time spent on each task.
- **User-Friendly Controls**: Start, pause/resume, and cancel the timer with intuitive buttons. Adjust timer intervals and manage tasks seamlessly.

## Usage

1. **Start Timer**: Click the "Start" button to begin a Pomodoro session. The timer will count down from 25 minutes by default.
2. **Pause/Resume**: Use the "Pause" button to temporarily stop the timer and "Resume" to continue where you left off.
3. **Adjust Intervals**: Increase or decrease the timer duration using the "+" and "-" buttons. Use "Short Break" and "Long Break" buttons to switch between break intervals.
4. **Task Management**: Enter tasks in the input box and click "Add Task". Tasks can be checked off when completed, and the timer tracks time spent on each task.
5. **Cancel Session**: Click "Cancel" to reset the timer and clear all tasks, starting a new session.
